# AI-Echo_Sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) method that evaluates the emotions conveyed in text. In this project, user reviews of the ChatGPT application are examined and categorized as positive, neutral, or negative. The objective is to uncover patterns in customer satisfaction, highlight recurring issues, and generate insights that can guide improvements to the overall user experience.Understanding Sentiment over review . Analyze the dataset and preprocess the dataset by cleaning stopwords, special characters,punctuations, missing values,converting all text to lowercase is done . Sentiment Creation is done using rating with >=4 is set to positive >3 is set to neutral and <=2 is set to negative. Data Augumentation is done in three steps.Contextual word substitution uses bert-base-uncased model to replace some words with the similar meaning words based on context.this technique preserves the original meaning of the text. Contextual word insertion using berrt-base-uncased model automatically insert contextual suitable words.This will help model understand intensity and modifiers.Paraphrasing is done by MiniLM-L6-V2 model which rewrite the original sentence with different words but with the same meaning.For each original sample 2 or 3 synthetic samples are created.Each syntheic sample keep the same sentiment label and combine with the original dataset.
MiniLM → converts text into strong contextual embeddings.
Logistic Regression → learns better with larger + diverse embeddings.
